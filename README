    California GNOME 3 Calendar
    ---------------------------

  * Introduction

    California is a calendar built for GNOME 3.  It allows you to view and
    manage your online calendars with a simple and modern interface.

    Visit https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/California to read about the current
    state of California's development and to make sure you're running the
    latest version.


  * Installation & Licensing

    Please consult the INSTALL and COPYING files for more information.


  * Quick Start

    California uses EDS (Evolution Data Server) as the back-end for managing
    your calendars.  If you've already added calendars to EDS via another
    application (such as Evolution), you should be able to see those calendars
    in California as well.
    
    If you haven't added any calendars to EDS, you can do so by choosing
    "Add Calendar..." from the California application menu.  You may need to
    enter a username and password for calendars you can write to (such as
    Google Calendar).
